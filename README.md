# Plant-DiseaseDetection
# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning

A deep learning-based web application that detects plant diseases from leaf images. The goal is to help farmers and agricultural experts quickly identify plant diseases and take timely action to improve crop yield and food quality.

## 🧠 About the Project

Plant diseases significantly impact global food production and farmer income. This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify plant leaf images and detect diseases. The system is integrated into a **user-friendly web app** to make diagnosis accessible and fast — just upload a leaf image and get instant results.

---

## 🌟 App Features

- Upload leaf images for real-time disease detection
- Multiple crop support (e.g., tomato, potato, corn)
- Web interface built using **Streamlit** or **Flask**
- Displays predicted disease name with confidence score
- Provides guidance or suggested treatment (optional)

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [PlantVillage Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)
- **Content**:
  - Over 50,000 labeled images
  - 38 different classes including healthy and diseased leaves
  - Crops: Tomato, Potato, Apple, Grape, Maize, etc.

---

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Streamlit or Flask (for UI)
- OpenCV, Pillow (for image processing)
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## 🧠 Model Overview

- CNN Architecture (VGG-like or custom)
- Image input resized to 128x128 or 224x224
- Layers: Conv2D → MaxPooling → Dropout → Flatten → Dense
- Trained on PlantVillage dataset
- Exported as `.h5` model for use in the web app

## 📈 Results

Crop	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Tomato	98.2%	98%	97.8%	98%
Potato	97.4%	97%	96.5%	96.7%
Apple	96.9%	96.2%	96.7%	96.4%




## ⚠️ Limitations

Performance may vary under different lighting or background conditions.

Only detects diseases present in the training dataset.

Real-world deployment may need retraining with local/regional crop images.
